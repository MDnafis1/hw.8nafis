<p class="experience">There's no denying Neymar is one of the greatest attackers around in the game. It's that simple.

    Sure, he might not quite have managed to scale the heights that some expected him to reach early in his career, as Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo's numbers remain out of his reach.
    
    But then again, can anyone really compete with those two? After all, Messi and Ronaldo are very much in a league of their own!</p></div>
